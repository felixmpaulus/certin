## GENERAL

- look at heymantle for design inspiration, onboarding, dashboard, report generation

## MVP NOTES -> AGILITY IS A HUGE ADVANTAGE

- dont build for scale & do not deliver too many features
- do not overbloat. do the absolute minimum. this increases agility which no big company has.
- do we need to store data at all for the mvp? Or can we do this app stateless without a backend? Would we need auth then? It would only be report generator. The data would still need to be parsed though. But stateless.
- do not get stuck on styling and looks. v0 is enough!
- try to build together with 1 or 2 logistics SMEs and use their data

## CORE Q: What would a business report need to include for an logistics SME so he would happily pay for it

- Basic financial report
  -- PNL
  -- Operation and strategy report
  -- Risk management report (dispute)
  -- Legal template generation
  -- Invoice summary reminder to the contractor

## TODOS

- excel track out sheet (in drive)
- talk with Suprith
- talk with Dmitri
- whats the mvp?

- build a mock prototype
- build landing page with Lovable
